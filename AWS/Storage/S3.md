<!-- Simple Storage Service (S3) -->

Object storage built to retrieve any amount of data from anywhere

<!-- Terms -->

* Object - A file with a unique key and a version id
* Key - The full path of prefix (s3://bucket/dir/) + object name (file.txt)
* Version - Enabled at bucket level, same key overwrite will change the version
* Metadata - A set of name-value pairs to describe object
* Bucket - A container for objects (name must be globally unique)
* Folder - There is no actual folder hierarchy, object keys have unique prefixes & delimeters (like paths), so it looks like buckets have folder hierarchy.

<!-- Operation -->

# Static Website Hosting

S3 can host static websites and have them accessible on the internet like http://bucket-name.s3-website-aws-region.amazonaws.com, if you get 403 make sure the bucket policy allows public reads.

<!-- Performance -->

# Replication

When replication is enabled for a bucket, it only replicates objects newly added to bucket, it does not replicate objects that are already in the bucket.

# Consistency

Eventually consistent (cloud storage in multiple zones)

<!-- Pricing -->

# Classes
https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/

## S3 Standard (general purpose)

Used for frequent accessed data, low latency and high throughput, 99.99% available

## Infrequent Access (IA)

For data that is less frequently accessed but require rapid access when needed, lower cost than S3 Standard.

* S3 Standard IA - 99.9% available, used for disaster recovery or backup
* S3 One Zone IA - 99.5% available, used for storing backup copies, highly durable in a single AZ but data lost when AZ is destroyed

## Glacier

Low cost object storage meant for archiving / backup.

* S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval - minimum store 90 days, fast retrieval
* S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval - minimum store 90 days, medium retrieval
* S3 Glacier Deep Archive - minimum store 180 days, slow retrieval

# Operations

* write (put,copy,post,list) - $0.005 per 1000 requests
* read (get,select) - $0.004 per 1000 requests

# Storage

* S3 bucket is charged based on accessed data, not on creation

<!-- Security -->

# Access

* IAM Policy - User based, which API calls should be allowed from an IAM user.
* Bucket Policy - Resource based, what operations are allowed to bucket and objects.
* Access Control Lists (ACLs) - Defines which AWS identities are granted access and type of access, each bucket and object has an ACL.

# Use Case

* Public Access - Bucket Policy
* User Access - IAM Policy
* EC2 Instance Access - IAM Role Policy
* Cross Account Access - Bucket Policy

# Encryption

* Server side - Automatic 256-bits AES encryption after file gets to server
* Client side - Encrypt file first before uploading

<!-- Test -->

# Usage

* Backup and storage
* Disaster Recovery
* Archive
* Hybrid Cloud storage
* Application hosting
* Media hosting
* Data lakes & big data analytics
* Software delivery
* Static website

# Replication

* Must enable Versioning in source and destination buckets
* Cross-Region Replication (CRR) - compliance, lower latency access, replication across accounts
* Same-Region Replication (SRR) - log aggregation, live replication between production and test accounts
* Buckets can be in different AWS accounts
* Copying is asynchronous
* Must give proper IAM permissions to S3

# Snow Family

Import data onto S3 through a physical device, edge computing

* OpsHub - Desktop application to manage Snow Family devices

# Shared Responsibility Model

## AWS

* Infrastructure (global security, durability, availability, sustain concurrent loss of data in two facilities)
* Configuration and
vulnerability analysis
* Compliance validation

## User

* S3 Versioning
* S3 Bucket Policies
* S3 Replication Setup
* Logging and Monitoring
* S3 Storage Classes
* Data encryption at rest a transit
