# Business
* product - elig check & elig details (cost transparency initiative)
* engineering improvements - unit tests with code coverages
* release level - alpha date adherence
* team level - knowledge sharing, support & train other team members

# Development
Contribute more independently and take more responsibilities

## Description
COLTEC has planned for development work in multiple areas like discovery, bug fixes, revamps of existing user interface, improvements of existing backend logic, and potential platform 2.0 integrations. It is important to contribute more independently because we need a fast learner and a steady contributor in all of these areas.
COLTEC contains developers of different experience levels. It is important to take more responsibilities like proactively seeking help, voluntarily offering help, and maintaining transparency of efforts to improve the team's overall productivity.
