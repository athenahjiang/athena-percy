# career path
next steps? lmts?

# brand building
be more visible in the zone
too much work in the team rn
will talk more once dr stuff come again

# manage
scrum master rotation (shows planning and organizing skills)
build more ownership in the team
only do important things but manage other things
maybe i want to shift towards infra + backend
