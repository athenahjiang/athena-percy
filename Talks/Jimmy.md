# sfn
what is colins use case
what is the cost vs perf tradeoff
turn elis into serverless
the usage of endpoints are too high for serverless?
i just feel like workflows are so useful
whish if there's some tool to transform code and graph

# aws
glance cost advisor
aws billing & cost mgmt

# poc list
multi region dr
elid call monolith save dom

# tech
what is the best way to reach you?
rank channel, office hour chat, dm
things don't really concern the rest
a lot of times ppl chime in
i find it more annoying than helpful
feel free to delay response
great idea to rotate sprint between 2 teams
elis clean code smuggle on your coltec sprint
